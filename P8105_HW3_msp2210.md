## Problem 1

Loading and inspecting data

``` r
data("instacart")
```

There are 1384617 observations in this dataset, with the following 15
variables: order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id,
eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day,
days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle,
department. Some of the key variables are `order_id` and `user_id` which
give information on the individual ordering these items on Instacart.
Other key variables are `product_name`, which refers to what product(s)
the individual ordered, and `aisle` and `department` which give location
data within the grocery store.

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  distinct(aisle) %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>

    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699

    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
