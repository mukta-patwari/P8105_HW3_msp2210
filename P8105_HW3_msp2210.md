## Problem 1

Loading and inspecting data

``` r
data("instacart")
```

There are 1384617 observations in this dataset, with the following 15
variables: order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id,
eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day,
days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle,
department. Some of the key variables are `order_id` and `user_id` which
give information on the individual ordering these items on Instacart.
Other key variables are `product_name`, which refers to what product(s)
the individual ordered, and `aisle` and `department` which give location
data within the grocery store.

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  distinct(aisle) %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

There are 134 different aisles in this dataset. The top 10 most
frequented aisles were: fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged
vegetables/fruits, yogurt, packaged cheese, water/seltzer/sparkling
water, milk, chips/pretzels, soy/lactose free, and bread.

**Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n()
  ) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, n), y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Items Ordered by Aisle (>10,000 Orders)",
    x = "Aisle Name",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered"
  )
```

<img src="P8105_HW3_msp2210_files/figure-gfm/aisle-plot-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot corroborates the results that were seen in the earlier
question, about how many items were ordered from each aisle which aisles
had the most items ordered - fresh vegetables has a high item count at
greater \>120000 orders, as does the fresh fruits category.

**Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.**

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  count(aisle, product_name) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  mutate(product_rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(product_rank <= 3) %>%
  arrange(aisle) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| aisle | product_name | n | product_rank |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|
| baking ingredients | Cane Sugar | 336 | 3 |
| baking ingredients | Light Brown Sugar | 499 | 1 |
| baking ingredients | Pure Baking Soda | 387 | 2 |
| dog food care | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe | 28 | 2 |
| dog food care | Small Dog Biscuits | 26 | 3 |
| dog food care | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats | 30 | 1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach | 9784 | 1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries | 4966 | 3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries | 5546 | 2 |

The table shows that in the baking ingredidents aisle, the products
light brown sugar, pure baking soda, and cane sugar were most ordered;
in the dog food care aisle, the most ordered products were “Snack Sticks
Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats”, “Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe”
and small dog biscuits; in the packaged vegetables fruits aisle, the
most ordered items were organic baby spinach, organic raspberries, and
organic blueberries.
