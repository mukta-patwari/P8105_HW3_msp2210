## Problem 1

Loading and inspecting data

``` r
data("instacart")
```

There are 1384617 observations in this dataset, with the following 15
variables: order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id,
eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day,
days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle,
department. Some of the key variables are `order_id` and `user_id` which
give information on the individual ordering these items on Instacart.
Other key variables are `product_name`, which refers to what product(s)
the individual ordered, and `aisle` and `department` which give location
data within the grocery store.
